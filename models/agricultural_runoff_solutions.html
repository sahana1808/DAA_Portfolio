            <h2>Dynamic Programming (DP) Applications</h2>
            <p>Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques are useful for solving agricultural runoff and eco-friendly fertilizer/pesticide design problems where decisions must be made sequentially under constraints. The following DP approaches are particularly relevant:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Example Application</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Optimize the amount and timing of organic fertilizer application to maximize crop yield while minimizing nutrient runoff.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Use a time-dependent DP model with the Bellman equation to decide the best fertilization schedule for each crop growth stage, considering constraints like soil saturation and weather forecasts.</p>
            <p>Dynamic programming provides a structured way to address the complexity and sequential nature of these problems in eco-friendly agricultural practices.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Key DP Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multi-Stage Decision Processes:</strong> Use the Bellman Equation for optimizing sequential decisions where outcomes at one stage influence the next (e.g., soil nutrient levels affecting the next application).
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Managing crop rotation and organic input application over years to minimize environmental impact.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Resource Allocation Problems:</strong> Use knapsack problem variants to optimize the allocation of limited resources (e.g., organic fertilizers) across multiple fields while minimizing environmental impact.
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Deciding the amount of fertilizer for each crop to maximize yield while staying within runoff limits.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time-Dependent Models:</strong> Use stage-based DP (finite horizon) to model decisions over multiple growth stages of crops to optimize yields and reduce runoff.
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Choosing the best organic fertilizer application schedule across a growing season.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Simulate runoff impacts for large agricultural lands by dividing the area into smaller grids. Solve for each grid independently and combine results.</p>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong> Split the problem (e.g., divide fields based on geographical features or soil types). Recursively solve and merge solutions (e.g., aggregate runoff results).</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Recurrence relation for complexity analysis (e.g., <code>T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)</code>).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Greedy Algorithms</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem Scope:</strong> Select inputs or allocate resources by making locally optimal choices at each stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Minimize fertilizer usage per crop while ensuring a minimum yield threshold. Select irrigation timings based on real-time soil moisture levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong> Define a greedy choice property (e.g., highest yield per unit of fertilizer). Ensure optimal substructure (e.g., local optimization aligns with global optimization).</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Prove correctness (if applicable) or measure performance with approximation ratios. Assess complexity for scalability across multiple fields or crops.</p>
